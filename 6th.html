				<p class="first-line">Robots have revolutionized industrial manufacturing, and they are also being used in food
				production and in kitchens in restaurants. Artificial intelligence (AI) robots are already capable of doing a
				wide range of jobs that call for learning and judgment, including self-driving cars, insurance assessment,
				stock trading, accounting, human resource management, and many functions in healthcare. So, will
				there be no jobs in the future, or will there be new jobs to replace the ones that are lost?</p>
				<p>The optimistic viewpoint claims that as automation continues to advance, it will lead to new job
				opportunities for individuals who have been laid off. There is some historical support for this: More than
				a century ago, people believed that the rise of the vehicle would be detrimental to the working class.</p>
				<p>The difference, though, is that current AI technology seeks to do more than just increase
				corporate efficiencyâ€”it seeks to supplant the human mind. Unprecedented effects will result from this
				that were not foreseen by the invention of the car or the automated knitting machine.
				AI&#39;s current era. An excellent documentary on the advancements and potential of artificial
				intelligence. How can we determine when something is too far?</p>
				<p>How much further can we go before it becomes too far? Awareness the solution to this question
				requires an understanding of the potential and limitations of AI. There are many misconceptions
				concerning artificial intelligence (AI) and how far it has advanced; this documentary explores these
				issues and aims to enlighten viewers.</p>
				<p>What response would you offer? Can A.I. compose music? Can it experience fear and
				excitement? Are they alive? The capabilities of a machine are pushed to the utmost by Mark Sagar and
				Will.i.am. Will a robot replace me at work?</p>
