				<p class="first-line">Artificial intelligence was initially developed to replace doctors. Researchers developed robots that could question you, analyze your responses using a learning algorithm, and identify whether you had the
				flu or a cold. However, because to the insufficient artificial intelligence algorithms used to implement
				them, these expectations were mostly unmet.</p>
				<p>Individual heterogeneity was particularly difficult since it made it impossible for machine learning
				algorithms to detect trends. However, deep learning, a subfield of AI, ultimately gained the sensitivity to
				identify speech from voice data. Despite the fact that deep learning algorithms required a large amount
				of training data, they may eventually learn to recognise words regardless of accents and other variances
				in speech patterns.</p>
				<p>Although object identification in image data is where deep learning is most frequently employed
				currently, it was initially used to understand speech. To recognize and avoid humans, for instance,
				driverless cars mainly rely on deep learning to ensure that their passengers get home safely. Deep
				learning is being used in the medical industry by a number of companies, including the San Francisco-
				based startup Enlitic, to detect aberrant tumors on radiological pictures that are likely cancerous.
				Several of these picture recognition methods are already in use in hospitals. But identifying diseases by
				processing pictures of them only taps a fraction of deep learningâ€™s power. Examining only its shape and
				density ignores the mountains of data hiding at the molecular level. This has not gone unnoticed.</p>
