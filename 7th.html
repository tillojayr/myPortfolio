				<p class="first-line">Many claim that humans are to blame for the planet&#39;s destruction. These

				<p>The world&#39;s salvation, one algorithm at a time. Many people argue that
				humans are to blame for the ruin of the earth. As a result, these people are
				striving to use artificial intelligence to save it. Technology may one day help
				prevent famine, the extinction of species, and conflict.</p>
				<p>The Earth is changing more quickly than it ever has in recorded human
				history, with swift societal upheaval, extreme climatic shifts, and terrifying mass
				extinctions. Despite the fact that the world is currently facing many problems,
				artificial intelligence might be able to help.</p>
				<p>Artificial intelligence (A.I.) is quickly affecting our civilization on numerous
				levels, from bioengineered meatless burgers to picture recognition used in crime
				prevention. However, the most fascinating—and for some, the most
				unsettling—feature of artificial intelligence is that it gets better at what it does
				over time.</p>
