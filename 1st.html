				<p class="first-line">	Artificial intelligence (AI) is just the emulation of human intelligence in machines that
					are built to behave and think like humans. The phrase can also be used to refer to any
					computer that demonstrates characteristics of the human intellect, like learning and problem-
					solving. AI aims to imitate the human brain and develop systems that are intelligent and
					autonomous. The age of AI, according to some, has arrived, then why aren't there flying
					automobiles or robot maids bringing us lunch.
					AI is made to make you unaware that a machine is making decisions. It is anticipated
					that AI will soon become significantly more clever and a little less artificial. Naturally, AI will
					start acting like an intelligent worker as it gets smarter. We will still need human professionals
					to build and maintain these synthetic BOTS and concentrate on the strategic and creative
					components of a job, even though the majority of the repetitive and mostly time-oriented
					duties can be automated using AI.

				<p>Technology is developing more quickly than ever before, and it is taking less time for it
					to become widely used. From writing to printing press, it took around 10,000 years, but just
					another 500 years for e-mail to be invented. It appears that a new era is just beginning. The era
					of AI A subfield of computer science called artificial intelligence (AI) studies how to simulate
					intelligent behavior in machines. AI is educating the machine, which makes it smarter. There
					was a time when only humans possessed intelligence, but that is no longer the case. The
					machines aren't programmed by us. Individually, they develop.</p>
