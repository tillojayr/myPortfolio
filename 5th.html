				<p class="first-line">Our planet is facing a historic climatic emergency, which is exacerbated by overpopulation and a
				food crisis. Is there a viable alternative that could solve these issues on its own?Some scientists believe
				that pushing the bounds of human civilisation to Mars and beyond is the only long-term solution.</p>
				<p>Experts from NASA and Wageningen University have collaborated to create viable houses for
				human existence.How can we cultivate food that can endure cosmic radiation, and how will we build
				colonies on Mars&#39; harsh surface? AI can determine the optimum shapes for our future Martian homes,
				where they should be put, and how to raise crops in space.</p>
				<p>With enough data, seemingly intractable topics can be made more approachable by artificial
				intelligence. This movie, narrated by prominent actor and science enthusiast Robert Downey Jr., well
				known for his role as Iron Man, introduces cutting-edge technology that has the potential to
				revolutionize agricultural and space exploration.</p>
				<p>Can AI power Mars&#39; &#39;Space Architects&#39;? Life on Mars will be nothing like David Bowie envisaged.
				Using artificial intelligence, architects and scientists are contemplating what it might be like to live in
				space and how it might be possible.</p>
				<p>The AI Era is a fascinating documentary about how far AI has come and how far it can go. How
				can we determine how far is too far? How far can we go before it&#39;s too late? Understanding AI&#39;s
				limitations and potential is critical to answering this question. There is a lot of misconceptions about AI
				and how far it has come; this documentary investigates the difficulties and aims to educate everyone
				about AI.</p>
