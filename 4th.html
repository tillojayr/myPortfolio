				<p class="first-line">What is the definition of love, and what is the definition of art? Humans have thought,
				debated, and argued about these concerns for millennia. As scholars get closer to turning these
				ideas into science, A.I. The projects are getting closer to becoming feasible possibilities for love
				partners as well as artists in their own right.</p>
				<p>The AI Era is a documentary film about how far AI has come and how far it can go. How
				can we determine how far is too far? How far can we go before it&#39;s too late? Understanding AI&#39;s
				limitations and potential is critical to answering this question. There is a lot of misconceptions
				about AI and how far it has come; this documentary investigates the difficulties and aims to
				educate everyone about AI.</p>
				<p>Robert Downey Jr., a science enthusiast and well-known actor best recognized for his
				role as Iron Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, outlines three significant projects with the
				potential to drastically revolutionize human society. Areas that you may have assumed were
				beyond the reach of A.I. Instinct, art, and love, for example, are now showing to be precisely
				the contrary.</p>
				<p>The episode follows Oscar Sharp, a Bafta-nominated film director, and tech artist Ross
				Goodwin as they attempt to create a cohesive film from a story created solely by an artificial
				intelligence algorithm.
				Artificial intelligence has made self-driving cars and robots that can converse warmly
				with people conceivable. When is it necessary to draw the line?
				The documentary tries to show that, rather than being a competitor, A.I. can be viewed
				as a collaborator capable of allowing us to produce creative work at previously unreachable
				levels.</p>
