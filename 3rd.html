				<p class="first-line">Artificial intelligence's (AI) current inability to represent and model human partners is the fundamental
				barrier to effective human-machine teaming. The current generation of AI agents are capable of obeying
				orders and performing tasks that fall within the purview of their training, but they lack the social
				intelligence that comes naturally to their human counterparts in terms of comprehending intentions,
				expectations, emotions, and other traits. The establishment of safe, efficient, and advantageous human-
				machine collaboration is hampered by this misinformation.
				&quot;</p>
				<p>As humans, we are able to infer unobservable states, such as situational beliefs and goals, and use
				them to foresee the next actions, reactions, or requirements of another person,&quot; said Dr. Joshua Elliott,
				a program manager in DARPA&#39;s Information Innovation Office (I2O). &quot;Machines need to be able to do
				the same if we expect them to collaborate with us in a meaningful and productive way or behave as
				trustworthy team members.&quot;</p>
				<p>However, it is challenging to educate machines social intelligence. The capacity of humans to naturally
				create mental images of their surroundings that resemble those of other people is known as theory of
				mind (ToM). By employing their ToM talent to infer the mental states of their teammates from
				observable actions and circumstances, humans can predict future behaviors based on these inferences.
				These theories are built around each person&#39;s preexisting set of experiences, viewpoints, and beliefs. By
				collaborating around crucial elements of their workplace, group, and strategy, team members establish
				shared mental models. ToM and shared mental models work together to foster effective human
				collaboration since they are both crucial elements of social intelligence in individuals.</p>
